## Rudimentary Installation Guide

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), preferably version 3.9 or above. During the installation, ensure that you check the box to install `pip` and set up the `PATH` environment variable. Restart your PC if necessary.

2. Verify that Python is working by opening a terminal (Command Prompt) and typing `python` (or `python3`). If issues persist, consider adding Python to the system's environment path.

3. Close the terminal, open a new one, and install dependencies by running `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. If this command fails, try using `python` instead of `python3`, or just `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you installed pip.

4. Download the source code by clicking the green `<> Code` button and selecting "Download ZIP."

5. Unzip the downloaded file using File Explorer or a similar tool.

6. Navigate to the unzipped folder containing the source code.

8. Run "start.py" by double-clicking it or running `python start.py` If it doesn't work, consider changing `python3` to `python` in the source code within "spawn-all.py."
